implement all of the features in @SPEC.md, use parallel subagents where it makes sense. Look up documentation with context7 for external libraries. Work methodically through each feature and don't continue to the next feature until all of the relevant tests pass. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES remove tests. You can alter tests if they are making invalid assumptions, but the spec is invariant. Commit each feature as you go with detailed commit messages. Do not try to use parallel sub agents for things that get implemented in the same file. Take your time, you've got this. I believe in you!
